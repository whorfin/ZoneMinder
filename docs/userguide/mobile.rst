Mobile Devices
==============

Here are some options for using ZoneMinder on Mobile devices:

Using the existing web console
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* You can directly use the ZoneMinder interface by launching a browser and going to the ZoneMinder server just like you do on the Desktop
* ZoneMinder also has a "mobile skin" that offers limited functionality (not all views are present in this skin). You can point your  mobile browser to ``http://yourzoneminderip/zm/index.php?skin=mobile``  and bookmark it

Third party mobile clients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* zmNinja  (`source code <https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmNinja>`__,  needs APIs to be installed to work)
	* Currently in free beta testing for iOS and Android. Will be in app/play store as soon as ZM 1.29 is launched
* zmView (limited, free) and zmView Pro  (more features, paid) - `website <http://html5-clouds.com/?q=node/55>`__
