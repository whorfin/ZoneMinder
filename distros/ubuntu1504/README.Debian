zoneminder for Debian
---------------------

There is one manual step to get the web interface working.
You need to link /etc/zm/apache.conf to /etc/apache2/conf.d/zoneminder.conf,
then reload the apache config (i.e. /etc/init.d/apache2 reload)

Changing the location for images and events
-------------------------------------------

Zoneminder, in its upstream form, stores data in /usr/share/zoneminder/.  This
package modifies that by changing /usr/share/zoneminder/images and
/usr/share/zoneminder/events to symlinks to directories under
/var/cache/zoneminder.

There are numerous places these could be put and ways to do it.  But, at the
moment, if you change this, an upgrade will fail with a warning about these
locations having changed (the reason for this was that previously, an  upgrade
would silently revert the changes and cause event loss - refer
bug #608793).

If you do want to change the location, here are a couple of suggestions.
(thanks to vagrant@freegeek.org):

These lines in fstab could allow you to bind-mount an alternate location

         /dev/sdX1 /otherdrive ext3 defaults 0 2
         /otherdrive/zoneminder/images /var/cache/zoneminder/images bind defaults 0 2
         /otherdrive/zoneminder/events /var/cache/zoneminder/events bind defaults 0 2

        or if you have a separate partition for each:

         /dev/sdX1 /var/cache/zoneminder/images ext3 defaults 0 2
         /dev/sdX2 /var/cache/zoneminder/events ext3 defaults 0 2

Access to /dev/video*
---------------------

For cameras which require access to /dev/video*, zoneminder may need the 
www-data user added to the video group in order to see those cameras:

  adduser www-data video

Note that all web applications running on the zoneminder server will then have 
access to all video devices on the system.
