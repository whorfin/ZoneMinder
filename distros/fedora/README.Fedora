New installs
============

1. Unless you are already using the MySQL server or you are running it
   remotely you will need to ensure that the server is installed and secured:

	sudo yum install community-mysql-server

	sudo systemctl enable mysqld

	sudo systemctl start  mysqld.service
     
	mysql_secure_installation

   NOTE: The Fedora team currently recommends mysql-community over mariadb

2. Using the password for the root account set during the previous step, you
   will need to create the ZoneMinder database, assuming your database server
   is local:

     mysql -uroot -p < /usr/share/zoneminder/db/zm_create.sql
     mysqladmin -uroot -p reload

3. The database needs a user.  One is not created by default because this would
   introduce an obvious security issue.  The following should set this up:

     mysql -u root -p
     grant select,insert,update,delete,lock tables,alter,create
     on zm.* to 'zmuser'@localhost identified by 'zmpass';

   Obviously, change at least zmpass to an actual, secure password or
   passphrase.  You can change zmuser as well if you like.

4. Edit /etc/zm.conf and, at the bottom, change ZM_DB_PASS and perhaps
   ZM_DB_USER to match.

5. Edit /etc/php.ini, uncomment the date.timezone line, and add your local
   timezone.  For whatever reason, PHP will complain loudly if this is not set,
   or if it is set incorrectly, and these complaints will show up in the
   zoneminder logging system as errors.

   If you are not sure of the proper timezone specification to use, look at
   http://php.net/date.timezone

6. This package probably does not work with SELinux enabled at the moment. It
   may be necessary to disable SELinux for httpd, or even completely for
   ZoneMinder to function. This will be addressed in a later release.  Run

     sudo setenforce 0

   for testing, and edit /etc/sysconfig/selinux to disable it at boot time.

7. IMPORTANT: Edit /etc/httpd/conf.d/zoneminder.conf and/or 
   /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.

   The httpd.conf file included with this version of Fedora processes the conf.d
   folder after the default ScriptAlias directive in the httpd.conf file.
   Previously, the conf.d folder was processed before the default ScriptAlias
   directive. This causes a ScriptAlias overlap and breaks Zoneminder's
   streaming abilities.

   WORKAROUND #1
   If you are running zoneminder on a dedicated server then the simplest
   solution may be to simply comment out the line in httpd.conf that reads:

	ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/var/www/cgi-bin/"

   WORKAROUND #2
   If you need both the default cgi-bin folder & the zoneminder cgi-bin folder
   then a solution might be to move the following line before the default
   ScriptAlias directive in the httpd.conf file:

	IncludeOptional conf.d/*.conf

8. Now start the web server:

	sudo systemctl enable httpd.service
	sudo systemctl start httpd.service

9. Now start zoneminder:

	sudo systemctl enable zoneminder.service
	sudo systemctl start zoneminder.service

Upgrades
========

1. Update /etc/zm.conf.  Check for any new settings and update the version
   information.  Comparing /etc/zm.conf and /etc/zm.conf.rpmnew should help to
   do this.

2. Add additional permissions to the zmuser account:

     mysql -u root -p
     grant lock tables,alter,create on zm.* to 
     'zmuser'@localhost identified by 'zmpass';

   Since this is an upgrade, the assumption is that the zmuser account already
   has select, insert, update, and delete permission.
   
3. You will need to upgrade the ZoneMinder database as described in the
   manual. Only if the previous step was succesful, may you run zmupdate like
   so:
   
   sudo zmupdate.pl --version=<from version>
   
   
   If unsure then run it this way:

   sudo zmupdate.pl --user=root --pass=<mysql_root_pwd> --version=<from version>
