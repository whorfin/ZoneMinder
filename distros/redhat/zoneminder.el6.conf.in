# When using Zoneminder's own authentication, recorded CCTV images are
# accessible from the web directly without passing the authentication. This
# means any attacker could see your CCTV images without a password. In order
# to avoid this you can disable Zoneminder's authentication and configure
# standard Apache authentication (see the Apache documentation for details on
# this).
#
# If you still wish to use Zoneminder's own authentication, or have an
# internal site which needs no authentication, you need to delete the line
# marked below and restart Apache.
