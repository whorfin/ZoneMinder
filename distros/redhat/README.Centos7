What's New
==========

1. The ZoneMinder mysql account now requires "Create" permission. This change
   must be done manually before ZoneMinder will run. See the installation steps
   below.

2. A new permission group called "Groups" has been added. This allows the
   system administrator to assign "view", "edit", or "none" permission to
   normal users, without giving them access to the rest of the ZoneMinder
   system. During an upgrade, existing accounts will default to a Groups
   permission of "none".

3. This package now requires the HTTPS protocol to access the web portal.
   Requests using HTTP will auto-redirect to HTTPS. See README.https for
   more information.
   
4. This package ships with the new ZoneMinder API enabled.

New installs
============

1. Unless you are already using MariaDB server, you need to ensure that
   the server is configured to start during boot and properly secured
   by running:

	sudo systemctl enable mariadb
	sudo systemctl start mariadb    
	sudo mysql_secure_installation

2. Using the password for the root account set during the previous step, you
   will need to create the ZoneMinder database and configure a database
   account for ZoneMinder to use:

     mysql -u root -p < /usr/share/zoneminder/db/zm_create.sql
     mysql -u root -p
         mysql> grant select,insert,update,delete,lock tables,alter,create
                on zm.* to 'zmuser'@localhost identified by 'zmpass';
         mysql> exit;
     mysqladmin -u root -p reload

   The database account credentials, zmuser/zmpass, are arbitrary. Set them to
   anything that suits your envinroment.

3. If you have chosen to change the zoneminder database account credentials to
   something other than zmuser/zmpass, you must now edit /etc/zm/zm.conf.
   Change ZM_DB_USER and ZM_DB_PASS to the values you created in the previous
   step.

4. Edit /etc/php.ini, uncomment the date.timezone line, and add your local
   timezone.  PHP will complain loudly if this is not set, or if it is set
   incorrectly, and these complaints will show up in the zoneminder logging
   system as errors.

   If you are not sure of the proper timezone specification to use, look at
   http://php.net/date.timezone

5. Disable SELinux 

   We currently do not have the resources to create and maintain an accurate
   SELinux policy for ZoneMinder on CentOS 7. We will gladly accept pull
   reqeusts from anyone who wishes to do the work. In the meantime, SELinux
   will need to be disabled or put into permissive mode.
   
   To immediately disbale SELinux for the current seesion, issue the following
   from the command line:

     sudo setenforce 0

   To permanently disable SELinux, edit /etc/selinux/config and change the
   SELINUX line from "enforcing" to "disabled". This change will take
   effect after a reboot.

6. Now start the web server:

	sudo systemctl enable httpd
	sudo systemctl start httpd

7. Now start zoneminder:

	sudo systemctl enable zoneminder
	sudo systemctl start zoneminder

Upgrades
========

1. Verify /etc/zm/zm.conf.

   If zm.conf was manually edited before running the upgrade, the installation
   may not overwrite it. In this case, it will create the file
   /etc/zm/zm.conf.rpmnew.

   For example, this will happen if you are using database account credentials
   other than zmuser/zmpass.

   Compare /etc/zm/zm.conf to /etc/zm/zm.conf.rpmnew. Verify that zm.conf
   contains any new config settings that may be in zm.conf.rpmnew.

2. Verify permissions of the zmuser account.

   Over time, the database account permissions required for normal operation
   have changed. Verify the zmuser database account has been granted select,
   insert, update, delete, lock tables, alter, and create permission to the
   ZoneMinder database:

     mysql -u root -p
         mysql> show grants for zmuser@localhost;
         mysql> exit;

   See step 2 of the Installation section to add missing permissions.

3. Verify the ZoneMinder Apache configuration file in the folder 
   /etc/httpd/conf.d. You will have a file called "zoneminder.conf" and there
   may also be a file called "zoneminder.conf.rpmnew". If the rpmnew file
   exists, inspect it and merge anything new in that file with zoneminder.conf.

4. Upgrade the database before starting ZoneMinder.

   Most upgrades can be performed by executing the following command:
   
     sudo zmupdate.pl

   Recent versions of ZoneMinder don't require any parameters added to the 
   zmupdate command. However, if ZoneMinder complains, you may need to call
   zmupdate in the following manner:

   sudo zmupdate.pl --user=root --pass=<mysql_root_pwd> --version=<from version>

5. Now start zoneminder:

	sudo systemctl start zoneminder
