What's New
==========

1. The ZoneMinder mysql account now requires "Create" permission. This change
   must be done manually before ZoneMinder will run. See the installation steps
   below.

2. A new permission group called "Groups" has been added. This allows the
   system administrator to assign "view", "edit", or "none" permission to
   normal users, without giving them access to the rest of the ZoneMinder
   system. During an upgrade, existing accounts will default to a Groups
   permission of "none".

3. This package now requires the HTTPS protocol to access the web portal.
   Requests using HTTP will auto-redirect to HTTPS. See README.https for
   more information.

New installs
============

1. Unless you are already using MySQL server, you need to ensure that
   the server is confired to start during boot and properly secured
   by running:

     sudo service mysqld start
     /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
     sudo chkconfig mysqld on

2. Using the password for the root account set during the previous step, you
   will need to create the ZoneMinder database and configure a database
   account for ZoneMinder to use:

     mysql -uroot -p
	mysql> create database zm;
	mysql> grant select,insert,update,delete,lock tables,alter,create
                on zm.* to 'zmuser'@localhost identified by 'zmpass';
	mysql> exit;
     mysql -uroot -p < /usr/share/zoneminder/db/zm_create.sql
     mysqladmin -uroot -p reload

   The database account credentials, zmuser/zmpass, are arbitrary. Set them to
   anything that suits your envinroment.

3. If you have chosen to change the zoneminder mysql credentials to something
   other than zmuser/zmpass then you must now edit /etc/zm.conf. Change
   ZM_DB_USER and ZM_DB_PASS to the values you created in step 2.

4. Edit /etc/php.ini, uncomment the date.timezone line, and add your local
   timezone.  PHP will complain loudly if this is not set, or if it is set
   incorrectly, and these complaints will show up in the zoneminder logging
   system as errors

   If you are not sure of the proper timezone specification to use, look at
   http://php.net/date.timezone

5. Verify the default ZoneMinder Apache configuration meets your needs:

     /etc/httpd/conf.d/zoneminder.conf

   When in doubt, leave this configuration as it is.

6. Configure the web server to start automatically:

     sudo chkconfig httpd on
     sudo service httpd start

7. This package will automatically configure and install an SELinux policy
   called local_zoneminder. A copy of this policy is in the documentation
   folder.
   
   It is still possible to run into SELinux issues, however. If this is case,
   you can disable SELinux permanently by editing the following:
   
   /etc/selinux/conf
   
   Change SELINUX line from "enforcing" to "disabled". This change will not
   take effect until a reboot, however. To avoid a reboot, execute the
   following from the commandline:
   
   sudo setenforce 0

8. Finally, you may start the ZoneMinder service:

     sudo service zoneminder start

   Then point your web browser to http://<machine name or ip>/zm

================================================================================
				UPGRADES
================================================================================

1. Verify /etc/zm.conf.

   If zm.conf was manually edited before running the upgrade, the installation
   may not overwrite it. In this case, it will create the file
   /etc/zm.conf.rpmnew.

   For example, this will happen if you are using database account credentials
   other than zmuser/zmpass.

   Compare /etc/zm.conf to /etc/zm.conf.rpmnew. Verify that zm.conf
   contains any new config settings that may be in zm.conf.rpmnew.

2. Verify permissions of the zmuser account.

   Over time, the database account permissions required for normal operation
   have changed. Verify the zmuser database account has been granted select,
   insert, update, delete, lock tables, alter, and create permission to the
   ZoneMinder database:

     mysql -u root -p
         mysql> show grants for zmuser@localhost;
         mysql> exit;

   See step 2 of the Installation section to add missing permissions.

3. Verify the ZoneMinder Apache configuration file in the folder 
   /etc/httpd/conf.d. You will have a file called "zoneminder.conf" and there
   may also be a file called "zoneminder.conf.rpmnew". If the rpmnew file
   exists, inspect it and merge anything new in that file with zoneminder.conf.

4. Upgrade the database before starting ZoneMinder.

   Most upgrades can be performed by executing the following command:
   
     sudo zmupdate.pl

   Recent versions of ZoneMinder don't require any parameters added to the 
   zmupdate command. However, if ZoneMinder complains, you may need to call
   zmupdate in the following manner:

   sudo zmupdate.pl --user=root --pass=<mysql_root_pwd> --version=<from version>

5. Now start zoneminder:

	sudo service zoneminder start
